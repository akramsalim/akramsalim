### 🤖 What I'm Working On

- Building multi-task perception systems that combine:
  - Object Detection (YOLO)
  - Object Tracking (SORT)
  - Semantic Segmentation
  - Depth Estimation
- Integrating perception systems with robotic platforms
- Exploring real-time computer vision applications

### 🔭 My Projects

#### Perception Kit
A comprehensive computer vision perception system for detecting, tracking, and analyzing objects in images and videos. Designed as a modular system for robotics applications.

- Object detection using YOLO
- Multi-object tracking with SORT algorithm 
- Segmentation capabilities
- Sensor fusion and 3D visualization

### hyperspectral-denoising
I have build a Hyperspectral denosing tool that i achived SOTA result on Hyperspectral dataset

#### [ Other Project]
Brief description of another project i've worked on is coming so.
